    <p>A design is a plan or specification for the construction of an object or system or for the implementation of an
        activity or process, or the result of that plan or specification in the form of a prototype, product or process.<a href="https://www.notion.so/Design-Books-by-Womxn-People-of-Color-efaffa5233cc44a8b3bebb2d0a2b038f">book</a>
        The verb to design expresses the process of developing a design. In some cases, the direct construction of an
        object without an explicit prior plan (such as in craftwork, some engineering, coding, and graphic design) may
        also be considered to be a design activity. The design usually has to satisfy certain goals and constraints, may
        take into account aesthetic, functional, economic, or socio-political considerations, and is expected to
        interact with a certain environment. Major examples of designs include architectural blueprints, engineering
        drawings, business processes, circuit diagrams, and sewing patterns.[1]

      The person who produces a design is called a designer, which is a term generally used for people who work
        professionally in one of the various design areasâ€”usually specifying which area is being dealt with (such as a
        fashion designer, product designer, web designer or interior designer), but also others such as architects and
        engineers. A designer's sequence of activities is called a design process, possibly using design methods. The
        process of creating a design can be brief (a quick sketch) or lengthy and complicated, involving considerable
        research, negotiation, reflection, modeling, interactive adjustment and re-design.</p>
